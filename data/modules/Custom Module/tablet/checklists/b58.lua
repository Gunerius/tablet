    STARTING (Repeat for second engine)
CAUTION
Do not engage starters for more than 30 seconds in any 4-
minute period.
NOTE
If the engine is hot, and the ambient temperature is 32Â°C or
above, place mixture control in IDEL CUT-OFF, switch fuel
boost pump to HI for 30 to 60 seconds, then OFF. Return
mixture control to FULL RICH.
In the event of a balked start (or overprime condition) place
mixture control in IDLE CUT-OFF and open the throttle;
operate the starter to remove excess of fuel. As engine starts,
reduce the throttle to idle rpm and place the mixture control in
FULL RICH. ]]
